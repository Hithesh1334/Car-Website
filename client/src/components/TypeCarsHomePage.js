                    A sedan is defined as a 4-door passenger car with a trunk that is separate from the passengers with a three-box body: the engine, the area for passengers, and the trunk. Throughout the generations, the definition of a sedan has been the same. Even after the many changes and facelifts in comparison to other car segments, it has continued to maintain its popularity as the flagship car for most automobile manufacturers with a large, growing demand base. Thus, facing a large amount of competition.
